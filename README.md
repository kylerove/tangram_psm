# tangram_psm
Rmd with extension functions for tangram to allow for various propensity score matching tests between matched groups

# this sets up sample matched data for two scenarios: 1:1 matching and 1:many matching

# each scenario then has categorical x categorical or categorical x numerical tests that can be run (sometimes more than one, so user can pick)
